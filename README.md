# HR-Attrition-Analysis
This is a project carried out during my internship with meriSKILL. The dataset was provided by the company.

In this project, I used Python to clean the data and to remove the NaN columns.
I also used Python to get the correlation map for all the numerical variables in the dataset and to visualize the relation between a numerical data and qualitative data using a box plot.
Other visuals were done with PowerBi.
